# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – Breast Cancer Classification

This project applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign.

## Dataset
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (scikit-learn)

## Workflow
- Load dataset
- Train-test split
- Feature scaling
- Find optimal K value
- Train KNN classifier
- Evaluate performance

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Accuracy vs K graph

## Key Concepts
- Distance-based learning
- Effect of K on bias and variance
- Importance of feature scaling

This implementation is added alongside Logistic Regression for comparison.
